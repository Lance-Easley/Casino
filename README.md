# Side Project
This is my repository for my "Casino" project, 
the fourth project that I made during Base Camp Coding Academy.

## Casino
The Casino project is my favorite project as of early October.
This project has three different Casino games to play; blackjack, roulette, and slot machines, each with their own .py file
Blackjack was made first.
The player places their bet then recieves two cards.
Once the cards are given, the player can choose to hit or stay.
Then the "dealer", which is computer controlled, will be given two cards and will hit until their cards add up to 17.
Roulette was made second.
An f-string text graphic is displayed to show positions the player can choose.
The player can choose as many positions as he/she wants and can confirm by typing "c".
The computer then chooses a random number from the roulette table.
Once a number is choosen, the computer then looks at the player's position choices individually to determine what payouts should be awarded.
Slot Machines was made last.
The player places their bet and spins the machine.
There are multiple combinations that have different payouts if matched.
